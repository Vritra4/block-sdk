# breaking contains the options for breaking rules.
breaking:

  # use is the list of rule categories and ids to use for
  # buf breaking.
  #
  # Categories are sets of rule ids.
  # Run buf config ls-breaking-rules --all to get a list of all rules.
  #
  # The union of the categories and ids will be used.
  #
  # As opposed to lint, where you may want to do more customization, with
  # breaking is is generally better to only choose one of the following
  # options:
  #
  # - [FILE]
  # - [PACKAGE]
  # - [WIRE]
  # - [WIRE_JSON]
  #
  # The default is [FILE], as done below.
  use:
    - FILE

  # except is the list of rule ids or categories to remove from the use
  # list.
  #
  # This allows removal of specific rules from the union of rules derived
  # from the use list of categories and ids.
  #
  # As opposed to lint, we generally recommend using one of the preconfigured
  # options. Removing specific rules from breaking change detection is an
  # advanced option.
  #except:
  #  - FIELD_SAME_NAME

  # ignore is the list of directories or files to ignore for all rules.
  #
  # All directories and file paths are specified relative to the root directory.
  # The directory "." is not allowed - this is equivalent to ignoring
  # everything.
  #ignore:
  #  - bat
  #  - ban/ban.proto

  # ignore_only is the map from rule id or category to file or directory to
  # ignore.
  #
  # All directories and file paths are specified relative to a root directory.
  # The directory "." is not allowed - this is equivalent to using the "except"
  # option.
  #ignore_only:
  #  FIELD_NO_DELETE:
  #    - foo/foo.proto
  #    - bar
  #  WIRE_JSON:
  #    - foo

  # ignore_unstable_packages results in ignoring packages with a last component
  # that is one of the unstable forms recognized by the "PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX"
  # lint rule. The following forms will be ignored:
  #
  # - v\d+test.*
  # - v\d+(alpha|beta)\d+
  # - v\d+p\d+(alpha|beta)\d+
  #
  # For example, if this option is set, the following packages will be ignored:
  #
  # - foo.bar.v1alpha1
  # - foo.bar.v1beta1
  # - foo.bar.v1test
